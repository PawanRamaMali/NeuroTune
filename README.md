## Installation
To install **NeuroTune**, use the following command:
```bash
pip install neurotune
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started with **NeuroTune**:
```python
import neurotune as nt
from your_deep_learning_framework import YourModel, YourDataset

# Initialize your model and dataset
model = YourModel()
dataset = YourDataset()

# Choose an optimizer from NeuroTune
optimizer = nt.OptiBrain(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train your model with NeuroTune optimizer
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for data in dataset:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(data)
        loss = loss_function(outputs, data.labels)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
